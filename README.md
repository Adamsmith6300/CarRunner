# COMP-4995-DirectX-Proj (CarRunner game)

A 3D game built with DirectX12 where players race across cars to the finish line. If a player falls off a car or gets hits by flying skulls, the player resets to their starting position. First player to the end wins. Can be played in single player mode, racing to beat their best time (while avoiding the skulls), or in multiplayer mode with another player over their local network.
